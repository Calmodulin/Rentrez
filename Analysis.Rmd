  + **Name**: Yudong Liu
  + **Github Repository Link**: https://github.com/Calmodulin/Rentrez
  + **Github user name**: Calmodulin  
  
### Load the data that we create in Part 1 into an object called Sequences 3
```{r}
Sequences3<-read.csv("Sequences.csv")
Sequences3
```
### Print out each sequence 
```{r}
SeqSub<-gsub("","",Sequences3$Sequence) #gsub is used to extract only the nucleotide basepairs from our Sequneces 3 dataframe 
SeqSub
```
### Count the number of basepairs in each sequences 
```{r}
library(stringr)#load Stringr library
A<-str_count(SeqSub,"A")#using str_count function to count the number of "A" in SeqSub data 
G<-str_count(SeqSub,"G")#using str_count function to count the number of "G" in SeqSub data 
C<-str_count(SeqSub,"C")#using str_count function to count the number of "C" in SeqSub data 
T<-str_count(SeqSub,"T")#using str_count function to count the number of "T" in SeqSub data 
```

### Print out the number of each nucleotide as a table for each of the three sequences
```{r}
ncbi_ids <- c("HQ433692.1","HQ433694.1","HQ433691.1")#Supply the same ncbi_id from Part 1 as the column names 
SeqTable<-matrix(c(A,G,C,T),ncol=3,byrow=TRUE)#Create a table called SeqTable, with the calculated A,G,C,T contents from the previous sectio. Make it with 3 columns as we have 3 sequences.
colnames(SeqTable)<-c(ncbi_ids)#Supply the column names based on ncbi_ids
rownames(SeqTable)<-c("A","G","C","T")#Supply the row names as the 4 base pairs (AGCT)
SeqTable#Print out the table 
```
### Include an image of a bacteria from the internet, and a link to the Wikipedia page about Borrelia burgdorferi
![Bacteria](https://www.illinoisscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bacteria_PNG41.png)
# [Borrelia burgdorferi Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrelia_burgdorferi)

### Calculate the GC Content
```{r}
library(scales) #load the scales library 
GCCount<-(G+C)/(A+G+C+T) #Calculate the GC content as the sum of GC / sum of AGCT
GCCountP <-scales::percent(GCCount) #Turn the calculated GC content into a percentage scale 
```
### Present the GC Contents that we calculated in a Table called GCTable 
```{r}
GCTable<-matrix(c(GCCountP),nrow=3,byrow=FALSE)
colnames(GCTable)<-c("GC Content")
rownames(GCTable)<-c(ncbi_ids)
GCTable
```
